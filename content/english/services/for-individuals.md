title: Services for Individuals
---

There is a lot of software that we rely on for our basic usage of the internet, and more and more it's fallen under the control of giant corporations who often provide free or very cheap services, one cost of which is selling your data and/or trying to influence your actions through highly targetted advertising.

We aim to provide a several hosted software applications which you can use as an individual, with no profit motive, no desire to get you hooked on the service watching ads, and no selling of your data.

## Social Media

With Facebook increasingly serving up ads instead of content from friends, and Twitter turning into an alt-right dumpster fire, there's never been a better time for an alternate social media platform.

### Mastadon

Mastadon is a twitter-like platform that is *federated*. You can have an account on our server in Merri-bek, and still follow and be followed by users on any Mastadon server anywhere in the world.

## Other Possibilities

Other software we could provide includes:

* Email
* Calendaring
* Image sharing
* Data backup
